# Deployment Guide for EC2 with S3 Integration

## 1. Pull New Code Changes from GitHub

### Step 1.1: Fetch and Pull the Latest Code
1. In your project root directory:
2. Fetch and pull the latest code from the branch `version1`

    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git pull origin version1
    ```

3. Do it both in the local machine and in the EC2 machine.

## 2. Configure Permissions and CORS for S3

### Step 2.1: Create the structure of the s3
1. Create an avatars folder in your s3
2. Add a user_default.png of your liking, make sure you have one file call user_default.png

### Step 2.2: Set Up S3 Bucket Permissions
1. Go to the AWS S3 Console.
2. Select the bucket you’re using (e.g., `grocery-s3`).
3. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab.
4. In the **Bucket Policy** section, add a policy to allow public GET and PUT requests for your bucket (update the ARN to match your bucket's):

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::grocery-s3/avatars/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
   
This policy gives public access to `GET` and `PUT` operations in the `avatars` folder. This setup allows users to retrieve and upload images without needing extra permissions.

### Step 2.3: Set Up CORS for the S3 Bucket
1. In the same **S3 Permissions** tab, navigate to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
2. Add the following CORS configuration:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
            "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT"],
            "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
            "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
            "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
        }
    ]
    ```

3. Save changes.

The CORS configuration allows access to the bucket from various sources. Here, `AllowedOrigins` is set to `*`, meaning it allows all domains. This is essential when accessing S3 resources from a web browser, as it prevents cross-origin issues.

## 3. Update Environment Variables (.env)

### Step 3.1: Set Up SSO for AWS Credentials
1. Use AWS SSO to get temporary access credentials (Access Key, Secret Access Key, and Session Token), Remember to check every time they change.
2. Update your backend `.env` file with these credentials:

    ```plaintext
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
    AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token
    S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
    S3_REGION=eu-central-1
    USE_S3_STORAGE=true
    ```
   
3. Update your frontend `.env` file with these credentials:

   ```plaintext
    REACT_APP_USE_S3_STORAGE=true
   REACT_APP_S3_BUCKET=grocery-s3
   REACT_APP_S3_REGION=eu-central-1
    ```

4. Be sure to create a new build folder after these changes to get the changes in your env file

### Step 3.2: Test Changes Locally
1. Activate the virtual environment for your backend.

    ```bash
    source backend/venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. Run the backend locally to ensure there are no issues with your setup.
3. Test frontend locally by generating a new build.
4. Try to add an avatar now to the user and see if is correctly saved in the DB with your S3 route

Testing changes locally helps catch any errors in your setup before deploying. By adding an avatar, you ensure the backend, S3 integration, and database are all correctly configured.

## 4. Deploy to EC2

### Step 4.1: Stop the Running App on EC2
1. SSH into your EC2 instance:

    ```bash
    ssh -i "your_key.pem" ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>
    ```

2. Stop any running instances of your app.

    ```bash
    pkill -f 'python run.py'
    ```

### Step 4.2: Remove the Existing Build Folder (if needed)
- Ensure the previous build folder is removed.

    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/AWS_grocery/frontend/build
    ```

### Step 4.3: Upload the New Build to EC2
1. From your local machine, upload the **updated** build folder to EC2:

    ```bash
    scp -i your_key.pem -r /path/to/local/build ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>:~/AWS_grocery/frontend/build
    ```

### Step 4.4: Start the App with New Code
1. SSH back into the EC2 instance if you aren’t already.
2. Activate the virtual environment and start the backend:

    ```bash
    source ~/AWS_grocery/backend/venv/bin/activate && cd ~/AWS_grocery/backend && nohup python run.py > ~/AWS_grocery/backend/app.log 2>&1 &
    ```

### Verify the App is Running
- Check logs for errors:

    ```bash
    tail -f ~/AWS_grocery/backend/app.log
    ```

- Access the app through the load balancer in your browser and test if avatars are working in deployment too.

## Things to remember

- **Rebuild Locally**: Create a new build locally once you confirm that everything works. This ensures your frontend reflects any recent changes, later send it to the EC2 machine using scp.
- **S3 Permissions**: Double-check that S3 permissions and CORS settings allow public access to avatar files.
- **Environment Variables**: Make sure the `.env` files on EC2 are updated with the latest configuration for proper S3 access.
- **SSO keys are temporal and will change**: Make sure the `.env` files on EC2 are updated with the latest SSO credentials in your env file.
